#Let’s go, Doc!

With: Sarah MP

#Setup:
* sign up for mapwarper.net
* bring your laptop, or borrow one (or just peek (consensually) over someone’s shoulder)!
* load your patience_and_enthusiasm file

#What we’re gonna do:
We will

* geo-reference the scanned map so that web tiles can be generated at mapwarper
* create GeoJSON data to be overlaid, using Mapbox
* create a custom base map (to serve as reference/present day) 

aaaand if we have time, we will

* integrate all assets, ready for you to post on your webpage

tl;dr

you’ll make a digital map out of a really old one! Handholding is provided.
